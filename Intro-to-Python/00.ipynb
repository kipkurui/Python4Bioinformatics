    "# Quick Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks. Although the HPC you will be using will have Jupyter setup, these notes are provided for you want to set it up in your Computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebooks, which contain a complete and self-contained record of a computation. These notebooks can be shared more efficiently. The notebooks may contain:\n",
    "* Live code\n",
    "* Interactive widgets\n",
    "* Plots\n",
    "* Narrative text\n",
    "* Equations\n",
    "* Images\n",
    "* Video\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good to note that \"Jupyter\" is a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python, and R; the primary languages supported by Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook can allow a computational researcher to create reproducible documentation of their research. As Bioinformatics is datacentric, use of Jupyter Notebooks increases research transparency, hence promoting open science. \n",
    "\n",
    "## First Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Download Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for your specific OS to your home directory\n",
    "    - Linux: `wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh.`\n",
    "    - Mac: `curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "2. Run:\n",
    "    - `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "    - `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "3. Follow all the prompts: if unsure, accept defaults\n",
    "4. Close and re-open your terminal\n",
    "5. If the installation is successful, you should see a list of installed packages with\n",
    "    - `conda list`\n",
    "If the command cannot be found, you can add Anaconda bin to the path using:\n",
    "    ` export PATH=~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH`\n",
    "\n",
    "For reproducible analysis, you can [create a conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) with all the Python packages you used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `conda create --name bioinf python jupyter`\n",
    "    \n",
    "To activate the conda environment:\n",
    "    `source activate bioinf`\n",
    "\n",
    "Having set-up conda environment, you can install any package you need using pip. \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install jupyter`\n",
    "`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`\n",
    "\n",
    "or by using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip3 install jupyter`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can quickly launch it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "`jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: We will use a jupyter lab for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is made up of many cells. Each cell can contain Python code. You can execute a cell by clicking on it and pressing `Shift-Enter` or `Ctrl-Enter` (run without moving to the next line). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Login into the web server\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to run this and other notebooks for the EANBiT course participants is to log into the Jupyter server (Unfortunately, this is not currently working). The steps for running notebooks are:\n",
    "* Log in using the username and password assigned to you. The first time you log in an empty account will automatically be set up for you.\n",
    "* Press the start button (if prompted by the system)\n",
    "* Use the menu of the jupyter system to upload a .ipynb python notebook file or to start a new notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further help\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Jupyter notebooks, check [the official introduction](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb) and [some useful Jupyter Tricks](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). \n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern, robust, high-level programming language. It is straightforward to pick up even if you are entirely new to programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, similar to other languages like Matlab or R, is interpreted hence runs slowly compared to C++, Fortran or Java. However, writing programs in Python is very quick. Python has an extensive collection of libraries for everything from scientific computing to web services. It caters for object-oriented and functional programming with a module system that allows large and complex applications to be developed in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "These lectures are using Jupyter notebooks which mix Python code with documentation. The python notebooks can be run on a web server or stand-alone on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is broken up into a number of notebooks (lectures).\n",
